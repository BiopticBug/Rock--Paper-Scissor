# Rock--Paper-Scissor
This Python project implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with multiple AI and human players. It features different player strategies, a game engine for matches, and unit tests to ensure the main player wins at least 60% against each AI opponent. The program supports verbose play and user input.
